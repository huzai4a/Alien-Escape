# Alien Escape
This was a project created by myself (Huzaifa Syed), Atif Saeed and Jacob Mendler. 
The overall premise was that an alien crash lands on Earth, having its spaceship broken down 
and scattered across the city. In light of hearing of an alien, all humans go into attack mode, 
with all forces after this lone extraterrestrial creature. Your job is to make it out of the city
alive by collecting the pieces of the ship. Your allies will occasionally catch wind of your 
location, sending you powerups to aid your escape:

- Heart - Extra Health
- Blue Cube - Temporary shield from all enemy fire
- Lightning Bolt - Ability to move much faster
- Black Star - A combination of shield and speed
- Grey Star - Invisibility from all enemies

We made this 2D top-down game as the final project of our grade 12 computer science class.
It's a little rough around the edges, but we never really got all the bugs fixed so there
might be things wrong here and there. Overall we were successful in completing most necessary 
features. All assets used were listed as free to use.
